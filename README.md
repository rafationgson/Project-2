# Summer products sold on the ecommerce website "Wish"
Dataset is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jmmvutu/summer-products-and-sales-in-ecommerce-wish?select=summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv

This is an exploratory data analysis of the summer products sold on the website to see what are the correlations that lead to high sales. After the analysis, I will create a machine learning model to predict how many units an item will sell based on several features.
